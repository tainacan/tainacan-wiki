# Capabilities and Users

> This page explains how **capabilities** are handled on Tainacan, as well as which are the available **user roles** and what each of them can do. For Tainacan versions previous to 0.15, check [this documentation](users).

Tainacan handles user permissions similarly to [WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/pt-br:Pap%C3%A9is_e_Capacidades). If you are familiar with WordPress roles and permissions, you are already halfway there!

A **permission** is what is checked when granting a user access to a screen, a button, or any system function. A **user role** is a way to grant a set of permissions to a user. Assigning one or more roles to a user can already be done in WordPress by any administrator with user editing permissions. With Tainacan, new roles are available: *Tainacan Administrator*, *Tainacan Editor*, and *Tainacan Author*.

Below we detail:

1. The [Tainacan User Roles](/tainacan-roles.md) (and how they compare with the default WordPress roles)
2. The [Tainacan Permissions](/capabilities.md)
3. How to [Manage User Roles](/manage-user-roles.md)
4. How to [Manage Specific Permissions](/manage-specific-capabilities.md) for certain collections
