# Template Tags

Just as WordPress has its [Template Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-tags/ ":ignore"), Tainacan has its own of this kind, which are essential PHP functions for theme developers who want to display content from the database and display them in nice HTML format.

In this documentation, you will see a technical list of our most important Template Tags. Some of them have their usage better demonstrated in the [Theme Development and Extension](/dev/#theme-development-or-extension) and others may also be worth checking code examples from [our compatible themes](/theme).
