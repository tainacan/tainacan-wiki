# Releasing a new version

This is a work in progress documentation on how to release a new version.

Assuming:

- `$CURRENT_VERSION` is the current "old" version (e.g. 0.10)
- `$NEW_VERSION` is the version we are releasing (e.g. 0.11)
- `$GIT_PATH` is where our repository is cloned
- `$BUILD_PATH` is where the plugin is configured to build, inside your WordPress plugins folder
- `$SVN_PATH` is where the WordPress.org SVN repo is

## Pre-release

Before we publish a new version, we always release one or more Release Candidates so the community has time to [test and make sure](/dev/tests-script) the new version of Tainacan is clean and ready to reach the world.

### Start in the git repository

```
cd $GIT_PATH
git checkout develop
git pull
```

### Create a new Release branch

Create a new `release/$NEW_VERSION` branch. If using git flow:

```
git flow release start $NEW_VERSION
```

### Edit version numbers

Edit `src/tainacan.php` and change the version numbers to `$NEW_VERSION`. Also, change the `TAINACAN_VERSION` constant after the comments section.

When releasing an RC version, append RC (number) to the version.

Also increase the `Tested Up` version, if applicable.

### Build in production mode

It is extremely important to build the release version in _production_ mode. Take time to compare your bundle final sizes, which should be considerably smaller than in _development_ mode.

```
./build.sh --prod
cd $BUILD_PATH
```


### Commit and push

Commit and push this release branch.

```
git commit -am"version $NEW_VERSION"
git push
```

### Update trunk in SVN

When we release the RC is a good time to update the SVN trunk. This will allow the community to work on the translations before the final release.

Note that the `Stable tag` in the `readme.txt` file must not be edited and keep pointing to \$CURRENT_VERSION.

1. Go to the SVN folder

```
cd $SVN_PATH
```

2. Make sure your local SVN is up to date

```
svn cleanup
svn update
```

1. Clean trunk

```
rm -rf trunk/*
```

2. Copy new files

```
cp -R $BUILD_PATH/* trunk/
```

4. `svn rm` all files that have been removed

```
svn st | grep '^!' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn rm
```

?> Note: when using this `svn rm` or `svn add` commands listed here, you may receive a warning message of "insufficient input parameters". This will happen if you haven't added or removed any file, only modified, which should be ok.

5. `svn add` every new files

```
svn st | grep '^?' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn add
```

6. Commit!

```
svn ci
```

### Publish the RC

Create a ZIP package with the built plugin and publish a blog post calling for tests.

Use previous blog posts as templates, keeping all the content explaining what an RC is and how to contribute.

### Test

Using the Test guide as a resource, test every feature of the plugin, including importers and exporters. With time, we can build more detailed test scripts and distribute tests among people in the community.

### Fix and publish new RC, or finish

If bugs are found, fix them and commit to the release branch. Publish a new RC, following the steps above, until we have a stable version we feel confident to release.

## Release

The plugin is ready to go. We have published one or more RCs and the community has tested it. Let us get it live to the world!

### Finish version number

Back to the git repository, make sure everything is up to date:

```
cd $GIT_PATH
git checkout release/$NEW_VERSION
git pull
```

Edit `src/readme.txt` and `src/tainacan.php` and change the version numbers to `$NEW_VERSION`.

In `src/readme.txt`:

- Edit `Stable tag` to \$NEW_VERSION
- If applicable, edit `Tested up to`

In `src/tainacan.php`:

- Edit `Version`
- Edit the `TAINACAN_VERSION` constant

Commit and push.

### Clean your folder to make sure everything is built

```
rm last-*
```

### Build in production mode

It is extremely important to build the release version in _production_ mode. Take time to compare your bundle final sizes, which should be considerably smaller than in _development_ mode.

```
./build.sh --prod
```


### Prepare SVN repo

clean trunk

```
rm -rf $SVN_PATH/trunk/*
```

### Copy new files

```
cp -R $BUILD_PATH/* $SVN_PATH/trunk/
```

Update assets

```
cp $GIT_PATH/wp-repo-assets/* $SVN_PATH/assets/
```

### Commit

Before commit, verify the output of `svn st` and check if there are no undesired files or folders. Also, verify the total size of the trunk folder to see it looks ok.

1. Go to the SVN folder

```
cd $SVN_PATH
```

2. `svn rm` all files that have been removed

```
svn st | grep '^!' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn rm
```

?> Note: when using this `svn rm` or `svn add` commands listed here, you may receive a warning message of "insufficient input parameters". This will happen if you haven't added or removed any file, only modified, which should be ok.

3. `svn add` every new files

```
svn st | grep '^?' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn add
```

4. Commit!

```
svn ci
```

### Create the tag folder

```
svn cp https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/tainacan/trunk https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/tainacan/tags/$NEW_VERSION
```

### Check

In a few minutes, the new release should be available in the WordPress directory.

Check if everything is ok.

### Commit and create the tag on git

Once the release is tested and confirmed, commit and create the tag on git.

Merge the release branch into master and develop branches and create a tag.

Using git flow:

```
cd $GIT_PATH

git flow release finish $NEW_VERSION
git push --all
git push --tags
```

## Update this wiki!

The `/_coverpage.md` and `/pt-br/_coverpage.md` files of this Wiki have the version number on it, that is displayed on [home page](/). Make sure to keep it updated following our [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING)!
