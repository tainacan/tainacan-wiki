# Tainacan Users Permissions

This page explains how permissions are handled in Tainacan, what are the user's roles available and what each one of them can do.

Tainacan handles user permissions in the very same way WordPress does, so if you are used to WordPress Roles and Permissions, you won't have any trouble.

Default WordPress roles are assigned with new capabilities to work with Collections, Items, and other Tainacan specific operations. Additionally Tainacan creates new roles, relative to the core WordPress roles, that have the same Tainacan specific capabilities but don't have access to the rest of the administrative panel of WordPress. For example, WordPress Editor can manage everything inside Tainacan, and they can also create and publish pages, on the other hand, Tainacan Editors can't.

If you want to change permissions for specific roles or users, or even create new roles, you can always use one of the many WordPress plugins available for that.

In short, these are the roles and their main characteristics. A detailed description can be found in the next session. 

* Subscriber: Can't really do anything inside Tainacan.
* Collaborator / Tainacan Collaborator: Can create collections and items, but not to publish them.
* Author / Tainacan Author: Can create and publish collections and items, but can not edit published items nor edit other user's items.
* Editor / Tainacan Editor: Can create, publish and edit other users' collections and items.
* Administrator: Rules the world.

## Roles and permissions

Here you will find a detailed explanation of what each role can do with each part of Tainacan.

### Collections

These are the capabilities related to collection management.

**Note about Collection moderators**: Collection moderators have the same capabilities an editor has, but only about the collections he or she is moderating. Even if the user is a subscriber, he will act as if he/she was an editor for that specific collection.

### Items

These are the capabilities related to items management.

Every user in tainacan is granted a set of capabilities, for every collection in the repository, depending on his/her role.

Capabilities are independent for each collection. So a user may be editor in one collection but have no rights whatsoever in another collection.

Permissions to a specific collection may be granted to a user adding him/her as a moderator of the collection. In that case, he/she will have the same rights as an editor, but only for that specific collection.

Also, you may use a WordPress plugin to have granular control of capabilities for each user in each collection.

In the description below you will find the characteristics of all the capabilities that are applied for each collection. Each user and role have a set of all these 10 capabilities for each collection.
