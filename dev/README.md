# Tainacan for Developers <!--{docsify-ignore}-->

As you know, **Tainacan is a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) plugin** and is built on top of this very well known platform. If you are familiar with _WordPress_ it should be easy for you to understand how Tainacan is organized, how it interacts with the database and how to build your own features from it.

> [!WARNING]
> ## Well, but I'm new to WordPress <!--{docsify-ignore}-->
> 
> If you don't have experience with WordPress and would like to develop a plugin for Tainacan, or even contribute to the plugin, it's a good idea to learn some fundamentals. Those will be useful to everything you will deal with while working with Tainacan.
> 
> This is a non-exhaustive list of the most important topics you should look into:
> 
> <div class="two-columns-list">
> 
> - [WP_Query](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_query/ ":ignore") class - This is the heart of WordPress, the class that gives you the interface to query for posts in the database. All interaction with the database in Tainacan uses this class.
> - [Custom Post types](https://wordpress.org/support/article/post-types/ ":ignore") and [taxonomies](https://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies ":ignore") - All Tainacan entities, such as collections, metadata and items, are WordPress Custom post types, so it is helpful to understand how they are handled.
> - [The Loop](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/the-loop/ ":ignore") - One of the main WordPress elements used to interact through posts. Useful especially if you are tweaking with themes.
> - [Template Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-tags/ ":ignore") - Simple functions used by theme developers to display dynamic content. Usually, these function are used inside "The Loop" and Tainacan implements [it's own Template tags](/dev/template-tags.md).
> - [Template Hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/ ":ignore") - Crucial if working with themes.
