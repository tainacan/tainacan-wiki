# Hooks

In adittion to the [WordPress core hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/), Tainacan has its own hooks, which offer developers opportunities to **expand or alterate the behaviour os certain sections of code**. Hooks are divided into two types: [Actions](/dev/actions) and [Filters](/dev/filters). Check their documentation bellow:

- [Tainacan Backend Actions](/dev/actions#backend-actions)
- [Tainacan Backend Filters](/dev/filters#backend-filters)
- [Tainacan Frontend Filters](/dev/filters#frontend-filters)
