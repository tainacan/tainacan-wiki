# Tainacan Pages

With the Tainacan plugin activated in your WordPress, some special pages are created by the plugin itself. These are:

* Collections Page `/collections`;
* Page of all Repository Items `/items`;
* Item Pages of a Collection with slug *collection-name* `/collection-name`;
* Item Pages with a Taxonomy metadata with slug *taxonomy-name* that have a Term with slug *term-name* `/taxonomy-name/term-name`;

As you create Collections, Items, and Terms, you will automatically have access to them on your website at these addresses. In general, in the Tainacan administrative panel, you will find links to these pages in buttons with eye icons (like the one at the top right of this page). Furthermore, it's also possible to configure your **own pages** presenting your collections or explaining something about your repository. These are two different paths, but they are at your disposal thanks to the **integration of Tainacan with WordPress**. Learn more below:

## Tainacan's Special Pages

### Collections Page

`/collections`

Available on your website from the moment a collection is created, this page lists your collections with sorting, search, pagination, and table or card view options. It's a good way to provide the public with a systematic view of what collections exist in your repository.

### Repository Items Page

`/items`

Available on your website from the moment any item is created in any collection, this page lists **all items from all collections in the repository**. It will present some standard viewing modes, sorting options by repository-level metadata, and the listing of all filters from all collections, as well as a collections filter. Although access to all items is powerful, we **recommend using it with caution**. Filtering by a specific metadata of a collection, for example, will hide items that do not have that metadata from the list, which can be confusing for those who don't know the organization of your repository.

### Collection Item Pages

`/collection-name`

This is generally the most important page of a Tainacan installation. Here you have access to faceted search of items within a collection. We highlight the available resources:

* Collection Header (whose image, color, and description are configurable in the collection editing form);
* Filters (the same ones available in the administrative panel, as long as they are public);
* Simple Text Search and Advanced Search;
* Ascending or descending order by all public metadata;
* Viewing modes including Full Screen mode (these are enabled or disabled also in the collection editing form);
* Related URLs Modal, providing access to the same list in different formats such as JSON, HTML, CSV, PDF (if [the plugin](/pt-br/plugin-pdf-exposer) is installed) and with the possibility of performing mappings;

Note that the item list is then the page of a collection itself. If you click on a collection in the Collections List on the website, it will go to this list. However, you might prefer to have a [custom presentation page](/pt-br/gutenberg-blocks), for example, before redirecting to your item list. This can also be modified in your collection's configuration form.

### Term Item Pages

`/taxonomy-name/term-name`

Similar to a collection's item list, this page shows all items that have a taxonomy type metadata and that have a specific term in this metadata. The main difference from the collection list is that the header will have the term's image and description, configurable in its editing form.

This page is an excellent way to bring the concept of multi-collection "Exhibitions" to your repository. For example, if you have a collection of paintings and a collection of architecture with different metadata, but both have a **Artistic Movement** Taxonomy metadata, you can see all items of the **Renaissance Movement** term in one place, aggregating items from both collections.
